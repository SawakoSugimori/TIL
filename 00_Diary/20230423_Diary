# What I learned in this week
I learned about SQL in this week.  The usage of SQL is simple, but I felt the effectiveness of using SQL. 
There are a huge amount of information these days, so it is very important to know how to select and analyze data.
I'd like to get data from internet and analyze them by myself.
