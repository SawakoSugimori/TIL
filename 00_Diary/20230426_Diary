# What I learned today
I learned the basics of internet and JavaScript today.  
The syntax of JavaScript was not difficult to understand because it is similar to the syntax of C language.
However, I found it difficult to use various methods.
Also, I spent a long time to fix spelling mistakes.
I'd like to embed a JavaScript code in websites I created.
I'm excited to see how I can improve my websites.
