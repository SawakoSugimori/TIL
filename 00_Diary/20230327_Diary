#What I learned today
I learned about data structures in C.  I got to know about abstract data types, stack, realloc, and linked lists.
They were more difficult than other things in C. It was interesting to know that queue's and stack's the way of thinking are seen in everyday life.
I will write many codes to get used to these functions tomorrow.
