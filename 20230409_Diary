# What I learned today
I wrote codes in Python. 
I found that the algorithm of code in C and one in Python is mostly the same, but I need to adjust to the way Python writes 
I also learned the basics of design.
I've been working on making Websites now.
I want to make more sophisticated one, so I started learning about design.
I will practice more!
